# Don't Forget About Me
My first GitHub program was created in case you ever need to share something with a user if they minimize their screen.  Hey, it could happen.

It tells/requires you to start with your screen maximized.  Then adjust your speakers (there is sound once you minimize) and minimize the screen.  Like an insecure partner, it becomes quite clingy when you minimize.
